 # Eye Drowsiness Detection

## Overview

Eye Drowsiness Detection is a project aimed at detecting drowsiness based on the behavior of a person's eyes, primarily focusing on the frequency and duration of eye closures. This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build and deploy a drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Real-time detection of eye drowsiness using a webcam or recorded video.
- Notification alerts when drowsiness is detected to prevent accidents.
- Adjustable thresholds and parameters for customization based on individual needs.
- Support for different eye tracking algorithms and models.
- Integration with other systems for enhanced safety measures, such as alerting drivers or operators in critical scenarios.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/eye-drowsiness-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd eye-drowsiness-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   

## Usage

1. Start the drowsiness detection system:
   - Run the main script:

     ```
    gui.py
     ```

   - Ensure your webcam is properly connected and positioned to capture your eyes.

2. Adjust parameters (optional):
   - Modify thresholds and parameters in the configuration file (`config.ini`) according to your preferences or requirements.

3. Receive drowsiness alerts:
   - When drowsiness is detected (e.g., frequent eye closures), the system will trigger alerts such as sounds, notifications, or visual cues to warn the user.

4. Integration with other systems:
   - Utilize the provided APIs or methods to integrate the drowsiness detection system with other applications or devices, such as vehicle monitoring systems, surveillance cameras, or workplace safety solutions.
